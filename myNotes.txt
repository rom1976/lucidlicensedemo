1) Undefined error may come coz of any small issues, like wrong variables, arrays, objects syntax ..etc..

2) Axios.then(()=> do all tranformed data here in the first level) 

3) remove e.preventDefault for issues related default input behaviours.

4) useEffect dependencies are critical in see the results on screen correctly(even after state update or function calling ...)

5) Input lose focus while onChange event is used, the reason is it is defined in the same component out side main return.

   and trying use as a internal component, causes this error.

Solution : either remove the component and use it directly inside main return or use as an external componenent and then import it.
